Have ChatGPT Brainstorm a Topic

Give it a topic and it will recursively think about it.

Step 1) Click the link to navigate to prompt page [AutoThinkPrompt](https://github.com/Neur0plasticity/ChatGPTAutoThink/blob/main/prompt.autothink.txt)

Step 2) Copy Prompt.

Step 3) Paste Prompt in a brand new chatgpt conversation. [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat)

Step 4) In the prompt modify (USER REPLACES THIS WITH A TOPIC). For some reason when i tell it to ask you the topic it doesn't auto conversate.

Here is an example brainstorm conversation. [example](https://github.com/Neur0plasticity/ChatGPTAutoThink/blob/main/example.autothink.txt)
